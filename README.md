This is the forum software that Mario Making Mods's uses.

It's called Blargboard, and its made by StapleButter. We just use a base, and modify some parts of it for Mario Making Mods's Needs.
I wouldn't recommend you use this for your own forum, due to some parts being hardcoded. *cough* depot *cough*.
However, you can still experiment, send in some patches, features, etc...
